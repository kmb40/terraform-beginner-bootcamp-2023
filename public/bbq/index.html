    <p class="lead">The history of smoking meat can be traced back to the Paleolithic era, when early humans discovered that smoking meat could help to preserve it and make it more palatable. Smoke contains compounds that have antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, which can help to slow down the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms. Smoking also changes the flavor and texture of meat, giving it a unique and delicious taste.</p>

            Prep Time: 5 minutes <br>
            Cook Time: 1 hour <br>
            Total Time: 1 hour 5 minutes<br>
            Servings: 1 - 6 <br>
            <br>
            Ingredients:<br>
            Bone-in Ribeye Steaks ¾ to 1 lb per person<br>
            Olive oil<br>
            Salt and Pepper Rub<br><br>

            Instructions<br>
            Step 1: Season Steak(s)<br>
            Place the ribeye steaks on a cutting board.<br>
            Note: This one was just over 2 lbs and was about 3 inches thick. Any size and/or thickness will work but thicker is better in my opinion. <br>
            Drizzle olive oil onto them.<br>
            Use a basting brush to coat the entire piece of meat with the oil.<br>
            Sprinkle a generous amount of Jeff's Texas style rub onto the top, sides and bottom of the steaks.<br>
            Note: the Original rub (Jeff's Naked Rib Rub) is also very good on steak and I have used it many times with excellent results.<br>
            Let the steaks sit on the counter for a few minutes while you get the smoker ready. You will notice that within a few minutes, the rub begins to draw some of the moisture out of the meat. The moisture then mixes with the rub ingredients and it creates a paste.<br>
            Place the steaks on a Bradley rack or a cookie sheet to make it easy to transport them to and from the smoker.<br><br>
            Step 2: Smoke ’em up<br>
            I used the Weber Bullet smoker for this cook but any smoker will work great as long as it can maintain about 220°F. <br>
            Set it up for indirect cooking and use the water pan if your smoker was designed with one. <br>
            I recommend cherry wood for smoke but any smoking wood will work great for these.<br>
            Once the smoker is ready, place the steak right on the smoker grate or if you used the Bradley rack, you can just place the rack right on the smoker grate.<br>
            Keep the heat and smoke going for about any hour or until the internal temperature of the steak reads about 110-115°F.<br><br>
            Step 3: Finish on the Grill (optional but very good)<br>
            Once the steaks reach an internal temperature of 110-115°F, place them on an already preheated gas or charcoal grill. The grill needs to be very hot.. the hotter the better in my opinion.<br>
            Keep a close eye on the steaks and do not leave them alone at all. Place them on the hot grill for about 2 minutes then rotate them 90° to get nice looking grill marks.<br>
            In 2 more minutes or so, flip them over and do the same thing on that side.<br>
            The amount of time it takes to get a good char is completely dependent on the temperature of the grill so it may take more or less than 2 minutes.<br>
            As an alternative, you can bring them into the house and place them under the broiler of the oven for this charring step. You will not get the coveted grill marks but you will get a great char and color and because the heat is working on the top of the steak instead of the bottom, you’ll be able to easily see when it’s had enough and is ready to be flipped over.<br>
            Leave the smoker going and if the charring is complete but the steaks are not to your desired doneness, you can easily place them right back in the smoker until the desired temperature is acquired.<br><br>
            Step 4: Rest and Serve<br>
            When the ribeye steaks have reached your desired level of doneness (I recommend medium rare or 135°F for best flavor, tenderness and juiciness), lay them on the cutting board and cover loosely with a foil pan or piece of foil to allow them to rest for 10 minutes. During the resting period, the juices in the steak will settle down and redistribute throughout the meat. The meat will also raise a few degrees in temperature.
            Cut or carve the steak(s) as desired and serve immediately.<br>
            You can obviously cook them to a higher internal temperature if that’s the way you like to eat steak.<br>
            Enjoy the perfectly cooked smoked bone-in ribeye steaks!</p>
